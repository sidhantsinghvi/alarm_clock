Lab 1: Digital Alarm Clock
Overview
In Lab 1, I created three different digital alarm clocks using the Verilog programming language and the Digital tool. The labâ€™s objectives ranged from basic alarm clock functionality to more complex designs, including the French Republican calendar system. I tackled various aspects of digital circuit design, focusing on sequential logic and efficient simulation techniques.

Tasks
Conventional Alarm Clock: A basic digital alarm clock design.
French Republican Alarm Clock: A clock following the French Republican calendar.
French Republican Calendar Alarm Clock: An enhanced version incorporating the calendar.
