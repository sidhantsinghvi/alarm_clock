# Lab 1: Digital Alarm Clock

## Overview
In this lab, I created three distinct digital alarm clocks using Verilog and the Digital tool. The tasks included designing a conventional alarm clock, a French Republican alarm clock, and a French Republican calendar alarm clock. Each clock progressively introduced more complex functionality and required careful circuit design and simulation.

## Tasks
- **Conventional Alarm Clock**: Basic digital clock functionality.
- **French Republican Alarm Clock**: Integrating a calendar system.
- **French Republican Calendar Alarm Clock**: Enhanced with calendar features.

## Skills Learned
- Verilog Programming
- Digital Circuit Design
- Simulation and Debugging

## Deliverables
- Verilog Code Files
- Digital Tool Files
- Lab Report
