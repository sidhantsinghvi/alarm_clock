Lab 1: Digital Alarm Clock
Overview
In this lab, I created digital alarm clocks using Verilog and the Digital tool. I built three different clocks: a conventional alarm clock, a French Republican alarm clock, and a calendar-based alarm clock. Each design increased in complexity as I incorporated more advanced features.
